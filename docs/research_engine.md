# Autonomous Research Engine

The **autonomous research engine** runs in the background, gathering high-quality information on the topics you mark as interesting.  It does not block normal chat usage and can be turned on/off at any time.

## Why?

â€¢ Free the user from manual searching.  
â€¢ Surface fresh, credible insights.  
â€¢ Keep the assistant's knowledge up-to-date.

## How it Works

1. **Topic discovery** â€“ after each chat message the `topic_extractor_node` suggests candidate topics.  
2. **Subscription** â€“ the UI lets you enable research per topic; selected topics are persisted in `storage_data/`.
3. **Motivation model** â€“ internal boredom / curiosity / tiredness / satisfaction drives decide when to launch a research cycle (default every ~2 h on average).  You can tweak rates & threshold via environment variables or debug APIs.
4. **Graph workflow** â€“ the research LangGraph (`research_graph_builder.py`) runs: query generation âžœ web search âžœ quality scoring âžœ deduplication âžœ storage.
5. **Review** â€“ findings appear in the sidebar with summary, quality bars & source links.

## Controlling the Engine

| Action | HTTP route | Front-end |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Start | `POST /research/control/start` | EngineSettings modal |
| Stop  | `POST /research/control/stop`  | EngineSettings modal |
| Trigger single cycle | `POST /research/trigger/{userId}` |  Topics dashboard "ðŸš€ Research Now" |

### Motivation debug

* `GET  /research/debug/motivation` â€“ current drive values
* `POST /research/debug/adjust-drives` â€“ set boredom/curiosityâ€¦ manually
* `POST /research/debug/update-config` â€“ override threshold & decay rates at runtime

### Best Practices

* Begin with 1-2 focused topics (e.g. "GPT-4 performance benchmarks").
* Lower `RESEARCH_QUALITY_THRESHOLD` if you prefer more-but-noisier findings.
* Periodically mark findings as read or delete old ones to keep the sidebar tidy.
