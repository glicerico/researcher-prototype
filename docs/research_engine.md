# Autonomous Research Engine

The **autonomous research engine** runs in the background, gathering high-quality information on the topics you mark as interesting.  It does not block normal chat usage and can be turned on/off at any time.

## Why?

‚Ä¢ Free the user from manual searching.  
‚Ä¢ Surface fresh, credible insights.  
‚Ä¢ Keep the assistant's knowledge up-to-date.

## How it Works

1. **Topic discovery** ‚Äì after each chat message the `topic_extractor_node` suggests candidate topics.  
2. **Subscription** ‚Äì the UI lets you enable research per topic; selected topics are persisted in `storage_data/`.
3. **Topic expansion** ‚Äì the system automatically discovers related topics using knowledge graph analysis and AI selection (requires Zep).
4. **Intelligent motivation model** ‚Äì hierarchical system with global drives (boredom/curiosity/tiredness/satisfaction) that gate overall research activity, plus per-topic evaluation that prioritizes which specific topics to research based on staleness, user engagement, and success rates.
5. **Graph workflow** ‚Äì the research LangGraph (`research_graph_builder.py`) runs: initialization ‚ûú query generation ‚ûú source selection ‚ûú multi-source search coordination ‚ûú integration ‚ûú quality scoring ‚ûú deduplication ‚ûú storage.
6. **Review** ‚Äì findings appear in the sidebar with summary, quality bars & source links.

## Multi-Source Search Architecture

The system uses an intelligent multi-source analyzer that replaces the previous single-choice router:

### Intent Classification
The `multi_source_analyzer_node` classifies user queries into three intents:
- **chat**: General conversation, greetings, simple questions
- **search**: Information gathering requiring external sources  
- **analysis**: Deep analysis tasks using the analyzer node

### Source Selection (Search Intent)
For search queries, the system automatically selects up to 3 relevant sources:
- **Web Search** (`search`): Current information, news, general topics
- **Academic Search** (`academic_search`): Scholarly articles via Semantic Scholar
- **Social Search** (`social_search`): Community discussions via Hacker News API
- **Medical Search** (`medical_search`): Medical literature via PubMed

### Parallel Execution
The `source_coordinator_node` executes selected search sources concurrently using LangGraph's fan-out/fan-in pattern, then the `integrator_node` synthesizes results from all successful sources while gracefully handling any failures.

## Autonomous Research Multi-Source Flow

The autonomous research engine now leverages the same multi-source capabilities as the chat system:

### Research-Specific Source Selection
1. **Research Source Selector** (`research_source_selector_node`): Analyzes research topics to select the most appropriate sources
   - **Scientific/Technical Topics**: Academic + Web sources
   - **Medical/Health Topics**: Medical + Academic sources  
   - **Technology/Startup Topics**: Web + Social sources
   - **Current Events**: Web + Social sources
   - **Academic Fields**: Academic + Medical (if health-related)

### Enhanced Research Workflow
```

```

### Benefits for Autonomous Research
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Multiple perspectives on each research topic
- **Source Diversity**: Academic rigor combined with current developments
- **Parallel Efficiency**: All sources searched simultaneously
- **Quality Filtering**: Results assessed across multiple source types
- **Automatic Relevance**: Sources selected based on topic characteristics

## Hierarchical Motivation System

The research engine uses a two-tier intelligent motivation system combining global drives with per-topic evaluation for optimal research scheduling.

### Tier 1: Global Motivation Gates
Global drives determine whether any research should occur at all:

```
global_motivation = (boredom + curiosity) - (tiredness + satisfaction)
```

**Research cycle triggers when**: `global_motivation ‚â• MOTIVATION_THRESHOLD`

### Tier 2: Per-Topic Prioritization  
When globally motivated, the system evaluates **only topics marked for active research** by the user:

```
topic_score = staleness_pressure + (engagement_score √ó weight) + (quality_score √ó weight)
```

**Topics researched when**: `topic_score ‚â• TOPIC_MOTIVATION_THRESHOLD`

#### Research Findings Engagement (Primary Signal)
The engagement score heavily weights actual user interaction with research results:

```
engagement_score = (read_findings / total_findings) + recent_reads_bonus + volume_bonus
```

- **read_percentage**: Core metric - what % of research findings the user actually reads
- **recent_reads_bonus**: Extra weight for findings read in the last 7 days (up to +0.5)  
- **volume_bonus**: Bonus for users who accumulate many research findings (up to +0.3)

#### Staleness Pressure Calculation
```
staleness_pressure = time_since_last_research √ó staleness_coefficient √ó TOPIC_STALENESS_SCALE
```

- **staleness_coefficient**: LLM-assessed per-topic urgency (0.1=stable, 2.0=breaking news)
- **time_since_last_research**: Hours since topic was last researched  
- **TOPIC_STALENESS_SCALE**: Configurable time-to-pressure conversion (default: 0.0001)

#### Drive Updates Over Time

| Drive | When Active | Update Formula |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **Boredom** | Always (idle) | `boredom += BOREDOM_RATE √ó time_delta` |
| **Curiosity** | Always | `curiosity -= CURIOSITY_DECAY √ó time_delta` |
| **Tiredness** | During research | `tiredness += time_delta` then `tiredness -= TIREDNESS_DECAY √ó time_delta` |
| **Satisfaction** | After research | `satisfaction += quality_score` then `satisfaction -= SATISFACTION_DECAY √ó time_delta` |

## Topic Expansion System

The autonomous research engine can automatically discover and research **related topics** based on your knowledge graph and conversation patterns. This creates a natural expansion of your research interests without manual intervention.

### How Topic Expansion Works

1. **Knowledge Graph Analysis** ‚Äì Uses Zep's knowledge graph to find related nodes and edges connected to your existing topics
2. **AI Selection** ‚Äì An LLM analyzes candidates to filter and rank the most relevant expansion topics
3. **Similarity Validation** ‚Äì All candidates are validated against Zep's similarity scoring to ensure relevance
4. **Automatic Research** ‚Äì Selected expansion topics are added to your research queue and researched autonomously
5. **Lifecycle Management** ‚Äì Expansion topics are automatically managed based on engagement and quality metrics

### Expansion Requirements & Dependencies

**Critical Dependency:**
* **Zep Memory System Required** ‚Äì Topic expansion cannot function without Zep enabled
* If `ZEP_ENABLED=false`, expansion generation is completely disabled
* When Zep is unavailable, the system logs the limitation and continues with manual topic research only

**Graceful Degradation:**
* Core research functionality remains unaffected when expansion is unavailable
* Existing topics continue to be researched normally
* Users can still manually create related topics as needed

### Expansion Configuration

Key environment variables for topic expansion:

```env
# Enable/disable expansion generation
EXPANSION_ENABLED=true
ZEP_ENABLED=true  # Required for expansion to work

# Expansion limits and quality
EXPLORATION_PER_ROOT_MAX=2        # Max child topics per parent
EXPANSION_MIN_SIMILARITY=0.35     # Minimum Zep similarity score
EXPANSION_MAX_DEPTH=2             # Prevent infinite expansion chains

# LLM selection (optional enhancement)
EXPANSION_LLM_ENABLED=true
EXPANSION_LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
EXPANSION_LLM_SUGGESTION_LIMIT=6
```

### Expansion Lifecycle

Expansion topics are automatically managed through these phases:

1. **Active** ‚Äì Newly created, actively researched
2. **Paused** ‚Äì Low engagement, research temporarily stopped  
3. **Retired** ‚Äì Poor quality or very low engagement, marked for cleanup

**Engagement-based management:**
* High engagement (>35% findings read) keeps topics active
* Low engagement (<10% findings read) leads to retirement
* Quality scores below threshold trigger automatic pausing

### Troubleshooting Expansion

**No expansion topics appearing:**
* Verify `ZEP_ENABLED=true` in environment
* Check that Zep API key is valid and service is accessible
* Ensure you have conversation data in Zep (expansion needs existing knowledge graph)
* Check similarity thresholds aren't too restrictive

**Debug expansion generation:**
```bash
# Test expansion candidate generation
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/research/debug/expand/your-user-id" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"root_topic": {"topic_name": "Your Topic"}}'
```

### Best Practices

* Begin with 1-2 focused topics (e.g. "GPT-4 performance benchmarks").
* Lower `RESEARCH_QUALITY_THRESHOLD` if you prefer more-but-noisier findings.
* Use the debug API (`/research/debug/motivation`) to monitor drive levels.
* Periodically mark findings as read or delete old ones to keep the sidebar tidy.
* Enable Zep if you want automatic topic expansion, or rely on manual topic creation if Zep isn't available.

## Configuration Reference

All variables live in `backend/.env` (see template):

```env
# Research Engine
RESEARCH_ENGINE_ENABLED=true
RESEARCH_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
RESEARCH_QUALITY_THRESHOLD=0.6
RESEARCH_MAX_TOPICS_PER_USER=3

# Global Motivation Drives
MOTIVATION_THRESHOLD=2.0
MOTIVATION_BOREDOM_RATE=0.0005
MOTIVATION_CURIOSITY_DECAY=0.0002
MOTIVATION_TIREDNESS_DECAY=0.0002
MOTIVATION_SATISFACTION_DECAY=0.0002

# Per-Topic Motivation (NEW)
TOPIC_MOTIVATION_THRESHOLD=0.5      # Minimum score for individual topic research
TOPIC_ENGAGEMENT_WEIGHT=0.3         # Weight of user engagement in topic scoring
TOPIC_QUALITY_WEIGHT=0.2           # Weight of research success rate in scoring  
TOPIC_STALENESS_SCALE=0.0001       # Scale factor converting time to staleness pressure
```

### Staleness Coefficient Guidelines

The LLM automatically assigns staleness coefficients during topic extraction:
- **2.0**: Breaking news, urgent developments
- **1.5**: Technology trends, current events  
- **1.0**: General topics (default)
- **0.5**: Historical or theoretical topics
- **0.1**: Reference material, stable facts
