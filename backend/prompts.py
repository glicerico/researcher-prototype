INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Review the entire conversation history
2. Consider the user's existing research topics (if any) listed above
3. Identify NEW topics that would benefit from ongoing research or monitoring
4. Avoid suggesting topics that are too similar to existing ones
5. Focus on topics that are:
   - Substantive and research-worthy (not trivial questions)
   - Have evolving information (news, technology, trends, etc.)
   - Would benefit from periodic updates
   - Are specific enough to be actionable for research
   - Genuinely different from existing research topics

6. For each NEW topic, provide:
